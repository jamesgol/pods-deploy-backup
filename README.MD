Pods Deploy
==========

Deploys Pods configuration to a remote site. Copies Pods setup, Pods Template, Pods Pages and Pods Helpers via the WordPress REST API.

<strong>BETA SOFTWARE</strong>This plugin is still under development, and might bot work as expected or at all. The public/private key pair method for authentication is still being evaluated. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. It is strongly advised that deployments be done over HTTPS.

### Requirements
This plugin requires that on both sites you activate this plugin and the following dependent plugins:

* [WordPress REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/)
* [Pods](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/) version 2.4.3 or later.
* [Pods JSON API](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-json-api) version 0.2 or later.

In addition, pretty permalinks must be active on both sites.

### Instructions
Pods Deploy needs to be setup on both the remote (deploy to) site and the local (deploy from) site. You must manually allow deployments to a site. When you do a public/private key pair is generated. You must supply this key pair and the remote site's API url to the local (deploy from) site.

<em>Pods Deploy can not activate components on remote site, yet.</em> You must activate all necessary components before deployment. IE If you are deploying an Advanced Content Type Pod, you must manually activate the Advanced Content Type component on the remote site.

##### Remote (To) Site
* Activate Pods and Pods Packages component.
* Go to Pods Admin-> Pods Deploy page, "Allow Deploying To This Site" tab.
* Click the blue "Allow Deployments" button.
* Copy public and private keys.

Note: You can disable deployments from this tab. Doing so clears the keys. Reactivating generates new keys.

#### Local (From) Site
* Activate Pods and Pods Packages component.
* Go to Pods Admin-> Pods Deploy page, "Deploy From This Site" tab.
* Enter the remote site's API url, this is generally the site's URL /wp-json, but it may not be as that URL is variable via a filter.
* Enter the public and secret keys in their fields.
* Click the blue "Deploy" button.
* Magic /should/ happen. When completed, you should see a completed message and a remote site should have the local site's Pods.

<em>If you see any failure messages please</em>: [Please report them](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-deploy/issues) and include the `var_dump()` of the response that is generated.
